        question: "How much can I save?",
        answer:
            "The amount of money can vary depending on the role, but typically companies save 70-90% on salaries. Outsourcing is an effective way to grow your team while being financially responsible.",

        question: "What timezones do you recruit for?",
        answer:
            "Our team typically places candidates from the Philippines. Candidates that we place typically are comfortable with a typical US 9-5 or can work any other time zone you prefer. It really is your choice.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much do you charge?",
        answer:
            "We charge a $500 deposit to get started recruiting and then when we place a candidate we will bill our recruitment fee. It depends on the frequency you are hiring, but it is typically 30% of the annual salary. Your $500 deposit goes towards that 30%.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you have a placement guarantee?",
        answer:
            "If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the candidate that you hire or they quit in the first 6 months, we will find you someone else free of charge. We want to make sure that you find somebody who can work well with you and your time - that is our top priority.",
