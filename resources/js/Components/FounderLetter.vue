            <p>Potential is equally distributed; opportunity is not. A complex set of health, educational, and financial
                circumstances can limit opportunity for children and families living in urban poverty. Families
                struggling
                to make ends meet often cannot think beyond the next day, let alone plan for the future. To achieve the
                future they want, they first need a stable foundation.</p>

            <p>That’s why we work relentlessly to ensure more children and families have the support and resources they
                need — when they need them — to lead healthy and prosperous lives. We know that when families can meet
                their
                basic needs, they can overcome the barriers that lock them into cycles of poverty.</p>

            <p>True progress and transformative, sustainable change are the products of time, hard work, and a
                willingness
                to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who live and breathe the challenges we aim to overcome. We
                partner
                with nonprofits and social enterprises to find data-driven solutions that combine bold thinking with
                real-world understanding, focusing on communities in India, South Africa, and the United States.</p>

            <p>Finally, you leave the customer with a story that makes you easy to sum up.

                1/ Put yourself in their shoes

                2/ Explain their problem

                3/ Take ownership of it

                4/ Show the happy ending

                You're walking them down a path they'll want to walk themselves. Oh, and people buy from people.</p>
