            <p>Something has changed when it comes to building a team within your company. You used to post a job,
                invite
                people to an office to apply, and work closely with them daily.</p>

            <p>Today, you can hire anyone and work with people from around the world. Why would you limit yourself and
                your
                company to talent in the United States? </p>

            <p>Over the last 5 years, we have scaled our SaaS companies using international talent. They are driven,
                college education, professionals who speak English fluently. It has changed the way we operate and hire
                –
                introducing a complete mindset shift. 
            </p>
            <p> In 2021, we started Outwork Staffing to help bring this mindset shift to companies in the United States.
                You
                shouldn’t have to play by the rules of the last decade. We believe that companies should have the
                freedom to
                access qualified talent globally, without being confined to outdated practices. Whether it's customer
                support, administrative assistants, or developers, we can help you find the talent you need.</p>
            <p>Our recruiters are dedidcated to help you break free from old practices and holding your hand into this
                new
                unlock of global talent. Book a call with our team to learn more — no oligations.</p>
